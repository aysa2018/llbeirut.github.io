Project data was divided according into polygons, roughly corresponding to areas in greater Beirut. The first static image below shows these polygons: Western Beirut (blue), Eastern Beirut (red), southern suburbs (black), Zalka highway (orange), Metn (light green), Bay of Jounieh (olive green). The script for creating these polygons can be found [here](https://github.com/LLBeirut/llbeirut.github.io/blob/master/assets/scripts/LLB_polygons.R).
